# Analysis of OTC patterns

## Business Problem / Problem Statement 
This project involves an in-depth technical analysis of OTC Market transactions, providing investment solutions for securities not on a traditional exchange. These securities can include any derivative securities such as a stock or bond, but pose limited transparency, lack of liquidity, and limited available public information. This will allow the company to enhance its current offerings by providing investors with insights into market trends and sector-based trading problems. Through deep learning algorithms, the project will focus on providing a profit from the OTC market.

## Description of the company
The OTC (Over-the-Counter) market is a decentralized marketplace where securities not listed on formal exchanges, like the NYSE or NASDAQ, are traded directly between parties. It includes stocks, bonds, derivatives, and currencies, often involving smaller or less regulated companies. Transactions typically occur via brokers or electronic networks rather than through a centralized exchange.


## Business Requirements 
1. Developing a product to analyze the OTC market using technical analysis to determine if we can make a profit 
2. Visualize market trends through time series analysis for price per security 
3. Visualizing volume per sector and volume per security 

## Functional Requirements
1. Bar chart: one for volume per secor and one for volume per security 
2. Connect these sentences to a visualization 
3. Time series graph: price per security over time 
4. Must be modeled properly 
5. Facilitating technical analysis through indicators such as ()
6. (What kind of deep learning) to enhance analysis on and give insight on price and volume trends. 


## Data Requirements
1. Utilize OTC specific data such as Security ID, Company ID, Trading Symbol, etc. 
2. Extracting metadata for additional information
3. Ensure proper handling of datasets covering historical prices and volumes. 

## Technical Requirements
1. Data storage and management
2. Data processing
3. Data analyzation 
4. Deep Learning Implementation
5. Data visualization
6. Performance and scalability 
7. Infrastructure Standards: Define necessary hardware and software
8. Technology Directions: Align with strategic technology goals
9. Vendor Policies: Follow guidelines for vendor selection and usage
10. Cloud vs. On-Premises: Determine where work will be performed
11. Data Center Policies: Address location and access policies


## Regulatory Requirements
1. Compliance with SEC
2. Any other laws regulations and 
3. Adhere to Laws and Regulations: Examples include Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPAA, PCI
4. Industry-Specific Standards: Ensure compliance with industry guidelines
5. Security and Privacy: Address data security and privacy concerns
6. Cross-Border Compliance: Consider international regulations if applicable
7. Continuous Monitoring: Keep up with changing regulations
