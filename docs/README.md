# Analysis of OTC patterns

## Business Problem / Problem Statement 
This project involves an in-depth technical analysis of OTC Market transactions, providing investment solutions for securities not on a traditional exchange. These securities can include any derivative securities such as a stock or bond, but pose limited transparency, lack of liquidity, and limited available public information. This will allow the company to enhance its current offerings by providing investors with insights into market trends and sector-based trading problems. Through deep learning algorithms, the project will focus on providing a profit from the OTC market.
